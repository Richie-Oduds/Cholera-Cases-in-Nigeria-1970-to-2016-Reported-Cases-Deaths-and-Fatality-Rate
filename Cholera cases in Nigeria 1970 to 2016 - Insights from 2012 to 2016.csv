Country,Year,Number of reported cases of cholera,Number of reported deaths from cholera,Cholera case fatality rate,WHO Region,"I decided to check out some insights on cholera cases from 2012 to 2016, since most of the tragic and low cases happened between 1970 and 1991, and given that my entire data is between 1970 and 2016. I would like to find out the fatality rate, reported cases and reported deaths between the span of these years 2012 - 2016 as an added bonus to my project.       "
